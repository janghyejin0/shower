        Got me feeling like I can't be without ya
        Anytime someone mention your name
        I be feeling as if I'm around ya
        Ain't no words to describe you baby
        All I know is that you take me high
        Can you tell that you drive me crazy?
        'Cause I can't get you out my mind
        Thinkin' of ya when I'm goin' to bed
        When I wake up think of ya again
        You are my homie, lover and friend
        Exactly why
        You light me up inside
        Like the 4th of July
        Whenever your around
        I always seem to smile
        And people ask me how
        Well your the reason why
        I'm dancing in the mirror and singing in the shower
        Ladade ladada ladada
        Singing in the shower
        Ladade ladada ladada
        Singing in the shower
        All I want, all I need is your lovin'
        Baby you make me hot like an oven
        Since you came you know what I've discovered
        Baby I don't need me another
        No, no all I know (know)
        Only you got me feelin' so (so)
        And you know that I have to have ya
        And I don't plan to let you go
        Thinkin' of ya when I'm goin' to bed
        When I wake up think of ya again
        You are my homie, lover and friend
        Exactly why
        You light me up inside
        Like the 4th of July
        Whenever your around
        I always seem to smile
        And people ask me how
        Well your the reason why
        I'm dancing in the mirror and singing in the shower
        Ladade ladada ladada
        Singing in the shower
        Ladade ladada ladada
        Singing in the shower
        They ain't no guarantee
        But I'll take a chance on we
        Baby let's take our time
        (Singing in the shower)
        And when the times get rough
        There ain't no given up
        'Cause it just feels so right
        (Singing in the shower)
        Don't care what others say
        If I got you I'm stray
        You bring my heart to life yeah
        You light me up inside
        Like the fourth of July
        Whenever your around
        I always seem to smile

      I'm singin' in the rain
      Just singin' in the rain
      What a glorious feeling
      And I'm happy again
      I'm laughing at clouds
      So dark, up above
      The sun's in my heart
      And I'm ready for love
      Let the stormy clouds chase
      Everyone from the place
      Come on with the rain
      I have a smile on my face
      I'll walk down the lane
      With a happy refrain
      Just singin', singin' in the rain
      Dancing in the rain
      I'm happy again
      I'm singin' and dancin' in the rain
      I'm dancin' and singin' in the rain
